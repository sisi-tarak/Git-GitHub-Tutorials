# **Git and GitHub Series**  
Welcome to this tutorial series on Git and GitHub! Let’s start with the basics and build a strong foundation for understanding version control and collaboration.

## Session 1



#### **1.1 What is Version Control?**  

**Definition**:  
- Version control is a system that helps track changes in your files or code over time.

**Why Use Version Control?**  
- Keeps a history of changes made to files.  
- Helps multiple people work on the same project without conflicts.  
- Allows you to restore previous versions in case of mistakes.  

**Types of Version Control Systems**:  
1. **Local Version Control**: Tracks changes on your computer.  
2. **Centralized Version Control (CVS)**: Stores changes on a central server (e.g., SVN).  
3. **Distributed Version Control (DVCS)**: Each user has a full copy of the repository (e.g., Git).

#### **1.2 What is Git?**  

**Definition**:  
- Git is a distributed version control system used to track code changes.

**Features of Git**:  
- **Distributed**: Every developer has a full repository copy.  
- **Efficient**: Fast operations like committing and branching.  
- **Reliable**: Tracks every change without risk of data loss.  

**Advantages of Git**:  
- Enables team collaboration.  
- Easy branching and merging.  
- Tracks changes with commit history.  

**Who Created Git?**  
- Linus Torvalds, in 2005, primarily for Linux development.

#### **1.3 What is GitHub and Why Use It?**  

**Definition**:  
- GitHub is a cloud-based platform to store and manage Git repositories.

**Features of GitHub**:  
- Code hosting for version control.  
- Collaboration tools like Pull Requests and Issue Tracking.  
- Integration with other tools (e.g., CI/CD).  

**Why GitHub is Useful**:  
- Provides backup and remote access to your repositories.  
- Helps teams collaborate on projects easily.  
- Hosts millions of open-source projects.  

**Difference Between Git and GitHub**:  
- **Git**: A tool to track changes in your code locally.  
- **GitHub**: A platform to store and collaborate on Git repositories online.
